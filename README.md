1: Creage a project with vite.
2:Create two folder for frontend and backend.
3:frontend-> 
* We have included the Bootstrap for ui/ux.
* create a components folder.
*Inside components create Layout-> Layout.jsx, Header.jsx,Footer.jsx.
*create context folder in components  for login the form globaly using Context API for handling the data globally.
*inside page create home.jsx for form data.
*inside page create update.jsx for handle update form data.

4:backend->
*create the config folder for handle the database connection.
*create controller for handle the validation from server side or passwrod hashing & jsonwebtoken.
*Create helper for for Hashing the password in structure way.
*create middleware for secure the information or accessing before login.
*create model for initilize the data input  which we want to insert in schema.
*routes for managing the data from frontend to backend on prefered way to access eaisly.
* create .env file for environment variable accessing from anywhere.

  Node :-> from frontend you can handle the login form . you can upload multiple images in a time.
  you can get a jsonwebtoken. but here we are not using jsonwebtoken but creating it from backend with authentication or authorization.

  How to start ->
  * I've use vs code for IDE.
  *cd frontend -> npm install ->npm run dev.
  *open a new terminal in vs code.
  *cd backend -> npm install ->npm run dev
